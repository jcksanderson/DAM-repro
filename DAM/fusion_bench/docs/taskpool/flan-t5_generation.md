# Flan-T5 Models for Text Generation Tasks

This task pool provides a set of text generation tasks from the GLUE benchmark for the Flan-T5 model. 
Each task is associated with a dataset. 
We report the exact match accuracy metric for CoLA, MNLI, MRPC, QNLI, QQP, RTE, and SST2, and spearman's rho for STSB.
